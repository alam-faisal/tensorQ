# tensorQ

**tensorQ** is a Python library for simulating quantum computing using **tensor networks**, built using [ncon](https://github.com/mhauru/ncon).

## Key features
**Noise simulation**: efficient simulation of quantum computing in the presence of noise; realistic noise models tailored for superconducting quantum devices are included.

**General qudit support**: handles systems with arbitrary local dimension.

**Variational compilation**: Implements variational algorithms for state preparation and compilation, optimizing circuit execution under hardware constraints.
